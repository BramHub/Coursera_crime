Coursera - Peer-graded Assignment: Crime Analytics: Visualization of Incident Reports

Github created for hosting my submission for the Peer-graded Assignment on Crime Analytics: Visualization of Incident Reports for the Coursera course Communicating Data Science Results by University of Washington, week 1 Visualization.

In this assignment, I analyzed criminal incident data from Seattle or San Francisco to visualize patterns and, if desired, contrast and compare patterns across the two cities. Submission is in the form of a a Jupyter notebook.
